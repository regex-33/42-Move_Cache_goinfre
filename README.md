Introduction: Provide a brief introduction to the purpose of the scripts. Explain that these scripts are designed to move cache directories to a designated location (in this case, a goinfre directory) to free up space on the main drive.

Installation: Explain how to install and set up the scripts.

Mention that the install.sh script should be executed with the --classter argument followed by either mac or dell, depending on the system.
Explain that this script downloads the 42-move_cache.sh script, sets up a desktop entry to run it automatically on login, and moves cache directories to the designated location.
Usage:

Provide instructions on how to use the installed scripts.
Explain that the 42-move_cache.sh script should not be run directly but will be automatically executed on login after installation.
Mention that the cache directories listed in the script will be moved to the goinfre directory specified during installation.
Example:

Provide an example command or sequence of commands to illustrate how to install and use the scripts.
For example:
bash
Copy code
./install.sh --classter mac
This command installs the scripts for macOS. After installation, log out and log back in to execute the 42-move_cache.sh script automatically.
Requirements: Mention any prerequisites or requirements for using the scripts, such as having curl installed.

Notes:

Add any additional notes or warnings relevant to the usage of the scripts.
For example, you might want to advise users to verify the contents of the scripts before running them.
Here's a basic template for your README.md:

Copy code
# Move Cache to Goinfre

This script automates the process of moving cache directories to a designated location (goinfre directory) to free up space on the main drive. It includes an installation script (`install.sh`) and a script to move the cache directories (`42-move_cache.sh`).

## Installation

Run the `install.sh` script with the `--classter` argument followed by either `mac` or `dell`, depending on your system.

```bash
./install.sh --classter mac
This will download the 42-move_cache.sh script, set up a desktop entry to run it automatically on login, and move cache directories to the designated goinfre directory.

Usage
After installation, log out and log back in to execute the 42-move_cache.sh script automatically. Do not run the 42-move_cache.sh script directly.

The cache directories listed in the script will be moved to the goinfre directory specified during installation.

Example
bash
Copy code
./install.sh --classter mac
Requirements
curl must be installed.
Notes
Verify the contents of the scripts before running them.

You can customize this template further based on your specific requirements and usage instructions. Once you're satisfied with the content, save it as `README.md` in your GitHub repository.
